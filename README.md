# Hotel-Room-Reservation-System-C-Mini-Project
This project demonstrates key C programming concepts such as arrays, conditionals, and input validation.

This C programming mini-project is a simple room reservation system for Haritha Villa, a small hotel with 5 rooms. The system includes the following features:

-Check-In: Allows guests to book a room by providing their name and the number of members (1-4).
-Check-Out: Frees up a room when guests leave.
-Room Status Check: Displays the current status of all rooms, including whether they are occupied and the number of guests in each room.
-Input Validation:
*Prevents overbooking if all rooms are occupied.
*Ensures the number of guests is within the allowed range (1-4).
*Handles incorrect room number inputs during check-out.
